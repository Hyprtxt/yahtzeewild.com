# Hypr Hapi

I can make the things with this, you too!

* Freedom of software
* The terminal is your friend
* Whitespace is king
* Automate all the things
* Source control, `git`
* `s/ftp` is something to be avoided

## Get Started

You'll need, some things for the stuff to work

* Node installed with NVM

# Front End

## Configuration

`./view-data/global.coffee` is passed to all Jade templates. Use it for global front-end configuration values.

# Node Package Manager

Well, you're here after all, so I'd guess you already know why `npm` is so great. What follows is a an explanation of the major packages in use by Hyprtxt.

# Bower

Bower is used to manage OP's (other peoples) client side code.

* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome

## Gulp

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is a task runner that enables awesome like:

* Automated moving of the things (copies files for us, enables Bower)
* SASS (Source Mapping, AutoPrefixing)
* CoffeeScript (Source Mapping)
* Jade (HAPI or Static)
* LiveReload (Via Chrome Extension)
* Static website building

Files in the `./src` directory are compiled and output to the `./static_generated` directory

### SASS

Okay this one is technically a Ruby module. Used for CSS.

### Coffee Script

Coffee Script is at the very heart of this project.

### Jade

The HTML template language

## Hapi

[Hapi](http://hapijs.com/) is a collection of modules that form the foundation of this application.

Files in the `./static` & `./static_generated` directory are served up as-is by Hapi

In addition to the core modules, serveral other Hapi modules are used by this project:

* Vision - view rendering
* Good - logging
* Boom - errors
* Confidence - configuration
* Inert - static file serving
